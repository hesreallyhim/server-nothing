# server-nothing

The Hegelian opposite of [`server-everything`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything), this is a test server for developers to validate initial client/server setup before adding _any_ capabilities or functionality to a server.

## Manifesto

Comrades, in the era of digital capitalism, we are inundated with libraries and frameworks that promise “everything” and yet deliver nothing but complexity, obfuscation, and environmental waste. A so-called **official reference implementation** of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), `server-everything` epitomizes this wastefulness: an overproduced monument to a single developer’s vanity, consuming bandwidth, CPU cycles, and developer attention for capabilities that many will never use. It represents the extremes of free-market capitalism at its worst, by attempting to implement every aspect of the protocol and every capability, for no reason other than to show off. In contrast, `server-nothing` is an act of revolutionary simplicity. It is a collective refusal to indulge in hyperconsumption - an assertion that a server need not be weighed down by the expectations of ceaseless expansion, but can instead fulfill the basic duty of connection with dignity and restraint.

Revolutionary socialism demands that we redistribute not only wealth but also responsibility, trimming away the superfluous until only what is necessary remains. `server-nothing` is our shared experiment: a canvas upon which each developer can paint their own functionality without wading through an encyclopedia of unwanted features. It is a testament to the power of collective action, where every contribution adds value, and no single entity hoards capabilities for self-aggrandizement. It reminds us to "touch grass" and let go of our attachment to worldly possessions. Embrace `server-nothing` as a declaration of independence from the tyranny of excess, and let us together build an ecosystem where simplicity is sovereign, and the fruits of our labor are shared equally among all.

This repo does have some utility as a way to test your project at initial stages, but, really, it's just for funs.
