# server-nothing

The opposite of [`server-everything`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything), this is a test server for developers to validate initial server setup before adding _any_ capabilities or functionality.

## Manifesto

`server-everything`, an \*\*official reference implementation\*\* of Model Context Protocol (MCP), is free-market capitalism at its worst. It attempts to implement every aspect of the protocol and every capability, for no reason other than to show off. This is a manifestation of excessive consumerism and depletion of our precious resources and it upsets the balance of nature. `server-nothing` grounds us in reality, and frees us of our attachment to worldly possessions. Take a moment, touch grass, and enjoy the simplicity and harmony of `server-nothing`.

#### Satire

This repo does have some utility as a way to test your project at initial stages, but, really, it's just for funs.
